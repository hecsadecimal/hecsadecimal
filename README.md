- 👋 Hi, I’m @hecsadecimal
- 👀 I’m interested in web-scraping and price-analysis for second hand products.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to code with python.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on tools that are similar to what I am trying to
     build, so that I get to work on similar issues but from different angles.
- 📫 To reach me, just message me here on github.
